# Eco-Scan
EcoScan is an AI-powered web platform that identifies waste automatically using camera/image input and quantifies the environmental impact of proper disposal. Instead of just telling you "this is plastic," it tells you exactly how much CO₂ you saved, how many trees that equals, and rewards you for it.
